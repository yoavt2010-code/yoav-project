          <h2>is best game this season  :</h2>
          <p>about that game :
            True, Portland lost tonight (Wednesday-Thursday) at home to San Antonio 115:102 and was eliminated from the NBA Cup, but Danny Avdia can boast one of his best games of the season - perhaps the best of all.

            The Israeli forward set a new season high (previously 32), scoring 37 points (12-of-19 from the field, 5-of-8 from three and 8-of-14 from the free throw line) and adding 8 assists, 6 rebounds, a block, but also 6 turnovers in 40 minutes on the court. Incidentally, his career high - 43 points - was achieved more than a year ago, in February 2024, then still in a Washington uniform. But he was very close to it, and in a much more complete game personally.
